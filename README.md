# oMyTree
An AI system that transforms conversations into structured knowledge trees.

---

## Overview

**oMyTree** is an experimental system for converting unstructured conversations into
structured knowledge trees.

Instead of treating dialogue as a linear stream, oMyTree models each conversation as a
growing structure where topics branch, ideas evolve, and meaning accumulates.

The goal is to provide a clearer way to organize, revisit, and understand long-form
interactions with AI systems.

## Motivation

As AI systems become stronger, conversations become longer and more complex.
However, the interface to interact with them has not fundamentally changed.

Long conversations often result in:
- context fragmentation  
- loss of important reasoning paths  
- poor navigability  
- difficulty in reviewing previous insights  

oMyTree addresses these issues by restructuring conversation logs into a tree model
that better reflects how users think and explore ideas.

## Core Concept

oMyTree treats a conversation as:

- nodes: individual turns or semantic units  
- edges: relationships between ideas  
- branches: topic divergence  
- roots: core questions or goals  

Over time, a single chat evolves into a navigable knowledge structure instead of an
unstructured message stream.
