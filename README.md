# oMyTree

An AI system that transforms conversations into structured knowledge trees.

---

## Overview

oMyTree is a tool for turning long, messy conversations into clear, navigable trees of ideas.

Instead of scrolling through an endless chat log, you can:

- see how a topic develops step by step  
- branch off when a new sub-question appears  
- return to any point in the discussion and continue from there  
- review what you have actually learned, not just what was said  

The goal is not to replace thinking, but to make the structure of thinking visible.
